# Fáinne - Entry for Hackathon na Gaeilge 2018

This was my team's winning entry for Hackathon na Gaeilge - an Android app called Fáinne that lets users discover, organise and attend Irish language meetups across the world. We came 1st in the competition with our idea!

(Hackathon na Gaeilge is an annual hackathon for UCD students, ran by An Cumann Gaelach and sponsored by Bank of Ireland)

Most of the app isn't functional currently - it's mostly just pretty front-end stuff for now. We had a very limited amount of time to develop the app, and I was the only team member with app development skills, so I made the code myself in approx. six or seven hours. Chloe made all the mockups used in the presentation and in parts of the app (e.g. an Prófíl and the splashscreen) and the other team members mostly focused on making the presentation we had to do at the end of the hackathon as Gaeilge, as well as developing the idea with us, translating, etc.

The map function is based on Google Maps API V2 and [Google's sample code](https://github.com/googlemaps/android-samples/tree/master/tutorials/MapWithMarker), and I reused some code from my previous Android development projects.

Our team was comprised of:
- [Oisin Quinn](https://github.com/oisin1001) (that's me!)
- [Chloe Foxe](https://github.com/foxe22)
- [Darragh Clarke](https://github.com/DarraghClarke)
- [Sinead Farrell](https://github.com/sineadfarrell)
- [Charlie Kelly](https://github.com/charleskelly13)
